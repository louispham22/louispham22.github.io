AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional (SAP-C01) Exam Summary

``` - AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional (SAP-C01) exam was for a total of `170 minutes but it had 75 questions`. The questions and answers options are quite long and there is a lot of reading that needs to be done, so be sure you are prepared and manage your time well. As always, mark the questions for review and move on and come back to them after you are done with all.
	- One of the key tactic I followed when solving any question was to read the question and use paper and pencil to draw a rough architecture and focus on the areas that you need to improve. Trust me, you will be able eliminate 2 answers for sure and then need to focus on only the other two. Read the other 2 answers to check the difference area and that would help you reach to the right answer or atleast have a 50% chance of getting it right.
	- AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional (SAP-C01) focuses a lot on concepts and services related to Scalability, High Availability, Disaster Recovery, Migration, Security and Cost Control.```
